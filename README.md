## Problem
- Problem #0
  - **Teleportation in Astro haunted galaxies**
    - You have a teleporter that can take you from galaxy i to galaxy j. Cost to teleport is given by c(i,j), which can be arbitrary. Some galaxies are “astro-haunted” – this is specified by a(i) which can be 0 or 1 (1 means that that galaxy is “astro-haunted”). Give a polynomial time algorithm that minimizes the cost of going from galaxy 1 to galaxy n, such that you pass through no more than k astro-haunted galaxies. (You can assume that galaxies 1 and n are not astro-haunted.)

## How to Run (Examples)
### teleportation.py
> python teleportation.py 100
##### ***OR***
> python3 teleportation.py 100
- *The number is the value of n (Number of Galaxies)*

### Teleportation.java
> javac Teleportation.java \
> java Teleportation 100
- *The number is the value of n (Number of Galaxies)*
