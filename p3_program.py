"""
- Problem #0
  - Teleportation in Astro haunted galaxies
    - You have a teleporter that can take you from galaxy i to galaxy j.
    Cost to teleport is given by c(i,j), which can be arbitrary. Some galaxies
    are “astro-haunted” – this is specified by a(i) which can be 0 or 1 (1 means
    that that galaxy is “astro-haunted”). Give a polynomial time algorithm that
    minimizes the cost of going from galaxy 1 to galaxy n, such that you pass
    through no more than k astro-haunted galaxies. (You can assume that galaxies
    1 and n are not astro-haunted.)
